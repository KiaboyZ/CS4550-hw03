Please fill in answers to the questions below:


1. What's your name?
Kia Zafar

2. What hostname did you deploy to?
kia.town (hw03.kia.town for this assignment specifically)

3. Which parts of this assignment did you have trouble with, if any?
I had trouble with setting up react at first, and then understanding the point of useState.
My main issue was trying to get my react app up and working on my live website.

4. What external libraries did you use? For what?
The only things I imported were { useState } from 'react' for the ease of having easily set and updated variables within my app and the App.css file for styling.
I did install milligram and toy around with it for CSS styling, but I did not use it in the final build.
